YOU SHOULD SEE:
   ==================================================
     🧠 SMART AI ENGINE STARTED
   ==================================================
     Status: ✅ ONLINE
     Intelligence: Advanced
   ==================================================

STEP 3: KEEP THE WINDOW OPEN
-----------------------------
Don't close this window! The smart AI is now running.

STEP 4: TEST THE SMART RESPONSES
---------------------------------
Go to your chatbot and ask:
- "Explain photosynthesis"
- "Help me with calculus"
- "What caused World War II?"
- "What are the best study techniques?"

You'll get MUCH MORE DETAILED, EDUCATIONAL responses!

                    WHAT'S NEW IN SMART AI?
================================================================================

BEFORE (Old Engine):
"Math can be challenging, but let's break it down step by step!"

AFTER (Smart Engine):
"📐 Mathematics Help

Mathematics is the language of patterns and logic! Let me break this down:

Core Math Areas:
• Algebra - Solving equations, working with variables (x, y, z)
• Calculus - Study of change (derivatives) and accumulation (integrals)
• Geometry - Shapes, angles, spatial relationships

Problem-Solving Steps:
1. Read the problem carefully - what's being asked?
2. Identify what you know (given information)
3. Choose the right formula or method
4. Work through step-by-step
5. Check: Does your answer make sense?

Pro Tips:
✓ Practice daily (even 15 minutes helps!)
✓ Show all your work
✓ Draw diagrams when possible
..."

SEE THE DIFFERENCE? Much smarter and more helpful!
